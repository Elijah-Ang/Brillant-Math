# MathFlow

MathFlow is an interactive learning platform that prioritizes intuition over notation. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Philosophy

"Intuition First, Notation Second."
Users manipulate visuals to understand concepts before seeing the mathematical formulas.

## Architecture

- **Vanilla Stack**: HTML5, CSS3, ES6+ JavaScript.
- **Split-Screen Layout**: Interactive visual canvas on the left, narrative content on the right.
- **Data-Driven**: Lessons are defined in JSON files, allowing for a scalable curriculum.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. No build step required!

## Directory Structure

- `assets/`: CSS, JS, and Images.
- `data/`: Curriculum data (JSON).
- `modules/`: HTML fragments (if needed).

## Credits

Inspired by Brilliant.org's interactive learning model.
